# Category View

Similar to the overall summary view, Category View provides admins a quick glance at the learner enrollments, learner engagement, and course completion for a particular category. It provides insights on content quality, facilitates comparative analytics across courses in a category, and enables admins to notice things that require attention.

To access the Category View, you can either select the **View Analytics option from (…) More menu** for a category under the Courses tab or select a specific row from the category grid in the overall summary view page.

In this article, you will learn more about different metrics and reports available to administrators as part of learner analytics for a specific category:

## Permissions Level

The Community Training portal provides role-based administration, and depending upon the type of access level an administrator can perform certain actions on the portal. The table below shows the administrative roles that can access the Category View:  

|Access Level  |Category View|
|---|---|
|Global Administrator| Yes |
|Organization Administrator |No|
|Category Administrator|Yes|
|Learning Path Administrator|No|
|Course Administrator|No|
|Group Administrator|No|

## Insights on learner’s enrollment and course registration

This section in the Category View enables an admin to view learner enrollment over time and popular courses by enrollment among the learners for a given category. For example, the image below shows the information for a Healthcare category.  
![Healthcare category](../../media/image%2839%29.png)

### Learners enrollment over time

The graph provides information about all the learners enrolled for all the courses under a specific category over time. Hover over the title to view the description of this graph.

The values that are measured are:  

* x-axis — Timeline.
* y-axis — Number of unique learners registered across all courses under a category.

As shown in the image below, there are 46 unique learners enrolled on the portal as of 10th October.

### Top Courses by Enrollments / Courses with No Enrollments

This section provides a breakdown of the popular courses under a category. This comparative insight helps admins to take further action to improve the course content or to engage learners effectively. As shown in the image below, Simple diagnostics has the most number of users enrolled and there are no courses with zero enrollments.  
![No courses with zero enrollments](../../media/image%2867%29.png)

## Insights on learner engagement and course completion

This section in the Category View enables an admin to view course enrollment/completion over time and popular courses by completion among learners for a given category. For example, the image below shows the information for the Healthcare category.
![Information for Healthcare category](../../media/image%2868%29.png)

### Course enrollment/completion over time

The graph provides information about total course enrollment and course completion across all the courses under a given category over time. Hover over the title to view the description of this graph. The values that are measured are:

* x-axis — Timeline
* y-axis — Total no of course enrollments/completion across all the courses under a category

As shown in the image below, there are four course completions for the courses in the Healthcare category.

This view gives a graphical representation of the growth in the number of course enrollments and course completions for all courses for a given category over a period. The data presented can help take corrective measures if the course completion curve falls below the course enrolment curve by a wide margin.

### Top Courses by Completion / Courses with No Completion

This section provides information on popular courses by completions for a given category. This comparative insight helps the admins to take further action to improve the course content or to engage learners effectively.

## Comparative insights on course enrollment and completion for a given category

This section in the Category View enables an admin to compare learner enrollment and course completion across all courses in a category.

In the table below, for each course, you can see the number of lessons, number of quizzes (including exams),  unique number of learners enrolled, and the number of course completions with their course completion percentage.
